The progress of the project can be followed in the in [__project journal__](https://github.com/mitdbg/fastdeepnets/blob/master/journal.md)(Chronological order).

## Goal

The goal of this project is to try to "learn" the number of hidden units (neurons for fully connected networks and channels for CNNs), directly during training. The main motivation is to reduce the size of set of potential hyper-parameters and avoid overfitting by killing neurons while the network is trained.

## Context

This project is part of my (Guillaume Leclerc) Master thesis
