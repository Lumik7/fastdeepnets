\section{Conclusion}

We presented \shrink, an approach to learn deep network sizes while training.
\shrink employs a \swl, which deactivates neurons, as well as
of a method to remove them, which reduces network sizes, leading to faster
inference times. We demonstrated these claims on on two well-known datasets, on
which we achieved networks of the same accuracy as traditional neural
networks, but up to 35X smaller, with inference speedups of up
to 6X.
